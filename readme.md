### JS Clock Maker

- This is the second challenge in the 30 days of JS.
- I watched a few videos ahead and am mulling them over.
- Got to do the clock one today and I learned a TON about CSS.
- I have a lot of polishing up to do here and some bugs to work out but this is full featured.
- Will spend time learning more about the CSS when I am not so heavily focused on the JS
- More to come!
